# Imperative programming

This repository will hold all of the code done on lessons as well as the home work ones. 

Feel free to clone the entire repo and study it. If you have any questions just shoot right away, I will help anyone.

**NOTE**
A lot of the codes are very rough as I wrote it without giving it too much thought. I will try my best to come back and 
tidy up the code and comment it, but I cannot promise anything.
