# ELTE IK 2019-20 Fall semester

This repository will hold all of the code done during the fall semester of ELTE IK 2019-20.  

There are 4 programming languages in the first semester.
- C
- C++
- Python
- Haskell

Feel free to clone the entire repo and study it. If you have any questions just shoot right away, I will help anyone.

**NOTE**

A large part of the codebase is very rough as I wrote it without giving it too much thought. I will try my best to come back and 
tidy up the code and comment it, but I cannot promise anything.
